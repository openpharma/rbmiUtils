New submission

Package was archived on CRAN due to 'rbmi' archived. 
* This version is a minor update and re-release after rbmi is now available on cran. 
* Moved `tidyr` from Suggests to Imports as it is used in exported function `tidy_pool_obj()`.
* Added examples to `gcomp_responder()` documentation.
* Standardized examples to use native pipe operator `|>`.
